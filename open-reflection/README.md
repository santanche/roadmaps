# Open Reflection Roadmap
*updated at January 21th, 2023*

This roadmap comprises several initiatives we did not find a proper term for yet and we call open reflection. They are mechanisms to make explicit a learner's rationale concerning a subject.

## 1. Executable Concept Map

**Betty's Brain** is the only initiative we know until now that applies what we call an executable concept map.

> Segedy, J. R., Kinnebrew, J. S., & Biswas, G. (2015). **Using Coherence Analysis to Characterize Self-Regulated Learning Behaviours in Open-Ended Learning Environments**. *Journal of Learning Analytics*, 2(1), 13â€“48. [online](https://doi.org/10.18608/jla.2015.21.3).

Two important things to observe in this paper:
* The mechanism to build and process the executable concept maps.
* The learning analytics approach to evaluate the maps produced by students.
